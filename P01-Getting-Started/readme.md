# React Redux Getting Started

# Getting Started 

The goal of this section is to install the tools you will need to complete the tutorial. 

## Editor

You will need a code editor. You can use your favorite tool, any plain text editor will work. I'd recommend using an IDE with a built-in terminal, like: 

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)

## Command Line Tools NPM

Node package Manager is a tool for managing file dependencies. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) and install the version for your computer system. 

You'll use NPM to build and run your project and download and manage project dependencies.
