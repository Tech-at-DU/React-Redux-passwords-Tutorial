The idea of saving passwords is probably not a good one considering someone could read them if they sat down at your computer and used the browser, and the passwords could be lost if the browser's cache is emptied. What were you thinking? 

## Stretch Challenges 

If you got this app completed try these stretch challenges: 

**Turn this app into a todo list**

Thurn this app into a to-do list. Imagine you need to save a to-do item with a name and a completed property. Any to-do item can be marked complete. 

**Deleting items**

Add a button to delete items from the list. 

**Edit items**

Add a button that allows us to edit an existing item. 

**Priority**

Add a priority property to each to-do item. This can be a value like 1, 2, or 3, or a string like low, medium, or high. 

When displaying items display priority. 

**Sorting the list**

Add an option to sort the list. You can sort alphabetically or by priority. 

**Add a filter option**

Add an option that filters the list displaying only items that are completed, not completed, or high priority. 

**Add a date**

Add a date to each to-do item. Show a formatted date next to each item.
